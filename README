NAME
    Courgette - A story runner for Perl.

SYNOPSIS
    $ courgette features/login.feature

DESCRIPION
    Courgette is a testing framework to write and run tests in the form of
    natural language stories. These stories describe features that are desired
    in a software package and provide a list of steps to explain how they
    should work. These steps are codified in a way that ties them to code,
    written by a developer, in the background, and it's Courgettes job to run
    the code for the steps and to report their success / failure.

    See documentation in the executable and the modules for more information.
